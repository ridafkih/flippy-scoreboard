# Flippy Scoreboard

A little flippy-scoreboard exercise for fun! ðŸ˜›<br />
Made in the presence of some of the kind-folk in the web development community.

In this demonstration, it simply loops from 0 - 9999, while only altering the necessary values.<br />
This repository only serves to host a little demonstration for the web development community that watched me create this!

You can view the flippy scoreboard on [the designated 'GitHub pages' page.](https://rida.dev/flippy-scoreboard/)
